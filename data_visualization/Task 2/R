# Task 2: Which regions are targeted most often?

# To identify the most frequently targeted regions, we first grouped the death data by region and then summarized it by counting the number of deaths in each region. We also kept the location coordinates for each region for further visualization. To ensure the data set was complete, we removed any rows where the coordinate value was missing. The missing data were likely due to the AI-generated look-up table, which may have produced regions outside the provided list, possibly offering a more accurate result based on its knowledge. We dropped these rows since they could not be visualized on the map.

death_location <- deaths_detail_info |>
  group_by( region ) |>
  summarize( death_count = n(),
             fx = first(fx),
             fy = first(fy)) |>
  drop_na(fx, fy)

death_location

# To better understand the results, we visualized the data points on the map using a scatterplot. The map serves as the background, with each point representing a victim’s location. The size of the dots allows viewers to easily identify patterns in victim numbers across different regions.

# Read map image
map_raw_img <- image_read( got_map_url ) |>
  image_convert( format = "png" )

# Create a raster map with brightness adjustment
raster_map_img <- map_raw_img |>
  image_modulate( brightness = 120) |>
  as.raster()

# Calculate the image dimension
info <- image_info(map_raw_img)
IMAGE_DPI <- 96 # 96 dpi
width_in = info$width / IMAGE_DPI
height_in = info$height / IMAGE_DPI

# Plot the death count at their locations on the map

# Analysis: This map highlights regions with the highest death counts across the Game of Thrones world, with the largest concentration of deaths occurring in the central area of Westeros, specifically around King’s Landing. This distribution suggests that major conflicts and battles are concentrated in and around key political centers.
